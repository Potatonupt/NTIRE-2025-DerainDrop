## ðŸ§ª Test Instructions
You can test the pretrained models using the steps below.

### 1. Modify the Paths
Update the paths for:
- Datasets
- Pre-trained model weights

### 2. Run the Model
#### 2.1 WGWS
```bash
python testing_model_Seting1.py --flag K1 --base_channel 18 --num_block 6 --save_path [path to your save_path]
```
